          <p>
            I recently graduated in December of 2022 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Management
            Information Systems. During the last two years of college, I worked as an intern for Union Pacific cultivating my
            skills as a software developer, and accepted a full time offer upon graduation. I am looking for a fully remote
            software developer position because I am moving in June 2023, and my current position doesn't allow for relocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have experience working on both front-end and back-end development. At Union Pacific, I mainly focused on back-end
            Java development and gained experience using Java 8 in a microservice-based environment. However, for various school
            projects, I have worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web applications. I also work with a local small
            business owner to build and maintain a website to promote their business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love working in software development because I enjoy problem-solving and being in a field that requires constant
            learning and adaptation. As I'm just beginning my career, I'm looking for any opportunities to grow my skill set and
            learn from mentors and colleagues.
