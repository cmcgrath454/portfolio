          <p>
            In December of 2022, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Management Information
            Systems. While in college, I spent two years as an intern at Union Pacific, where I honed my skills as a software
            developer. Upon graduation, I accepted an full-time position with Union Pacific to assist with development efforts
            prior to the cut-over of their new system, despite having plans to relocate in June 2023. They were aware of my
            limited availability and that I could not commit to more than six months. Currently, I am searching for a fully remote
            software developer position.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am seeking employment with a company that values collaboration and offers opportunities for growth and development.
            My ideal workplace would provide mentorship programs, regular code reviews, and dedicated time for learning and
            exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about problem-solving and enjoy being in a field that requires constant adaptation to new
            technologies. As a recent graduate, I am eager to expand my skill set and learn from experienced mentors and
            colleagues. I thrive in environments that encourage teamwork and diversity of thought and am excited to contribute my
            skills to a dynamic and collaborative team.
