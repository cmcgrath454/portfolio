              Colin was a year-round intern with NetControl Locomotive domain during 2022. In December and was offered the
              full-time employee position, he accepted the offer and joined the NetControl Locomotive team. Initially Colin was
              asked to join the bleed-off analysis effort. He did very good contribution in this area. The bleed-off analysis is
              very complex, mainly because there are lot of unknowns and the set up is not straightforward to perform the
              analysis. Colin did an excellent job in this area. Later he was assigned to the development tasks and he helped the
              team in achieving progress in the areas of tech evolution, where we had to chase to complete the tasks within a
              short window.

              Colin is very good team player. Colin treats everyone with respect. He is available whenever needed. When the
              situation demanded and when requested, he jumped in and started performing the bleed-off analysis tasks, even though
              his primary interest was in learning the development process and gaining some hands-on development experience. Colin
              is very smart, very meticulous and he comes up with creative ways to achieve results. Initially he built the Python
              based tool on his own and performed the table-to-table and column-to-column comparison between the TCS and
              NetControl versions. He facilitated the discussion with others towards identifying the solution. Later Colin was
              assigned to development tasks, and he got the opportunity to learn the process, tools and also make contributions to
              code development, and he did a very good job in the assigned tasks.
            </p>

              Overall, the NetControl Locomotive team accomplished a lot in 2022! ...... Let us continue to help each other, work
              together as one team, as we have always been doing, and reach the milestones in a timely manner towards successful
              final delivery in 2023, with quality! Colin is great to work with and I am glad to have him as part of the team.

              Colin is currently a year-round intern with NetControl Locomotive domain. He is helping with the bleed-off analysis
              and learning the development process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colin joined the team early this year and he was asked to join the bleed-off analysis effort. Colin made very good
              contribution in this area. The bleed-off analysis is very complex, mainly because there are lot of unknowns and the
              set up is not straightforward to perform analysis. Given the situation, Colin did an excellent job in bringing it to
              the current state with respect to the comparison with TCS feed and identifying the gaps to be addressed.
            </p>

              Colin is a very good team player. When the situation demanded and when requested, he jumped in and started
              performing the bleed-off analysis tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colin is very smart, and he comes up with creative ways to get the results. He started focusing on table-to-table
              and column-to-column comparison between the production (TCS data) and dev (NC data). He built the tool using Python
              and started comparing the data on both sides. He identified the gaps, communicated to the team, and did an excellent
              job in documenting and following up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bleed-off analysis is very complex, where there are lot of unknowns, and analysis of these transactions need deeper
              digging into various TCS functions, besides digging into NC apps and BTP transactions logs. Currently the progress
              is very slow, despite all the effort. I would like Colin to continue to involve very closely with the bleed-off
              activities, find different (creative!) ways to make progress and help the team.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also started giving Colin opportunity to learn the core software development process, tools, etc. That is not
              getting enough momentum, as the need for focus on the bleed-off analysis is extremely high. We will continue to make
              conscious effort to provide Colin more development opportunities.
