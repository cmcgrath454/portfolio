          <h2>Small Business Website</h2>

          <p>
            I worked with a local business owner to create a custom website for his landscaping company. The owner provided me
            with an idea of how he would like the website to look, and we collaborated on finalizing the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still work with the owner by managing the site host, updating the content, and improving the design. Currently, I am
            learning about SEO to get the website to naturally rank higher on search results. I am also experimenting with
            different tools to optimize my workflow to add pages to the website as efficiently as possible, while maintaining
            optimal loading speeds.

          <p>
            For my university capstone project, I worked with a team to create a runtime complexity learning tool. My role was to
            write the backend logic to analyze Java code runtime complexity. I created an API and hosted it through AWS. Other
            members of the group created a front-end that called the API to analyze user code input.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote the API in JavaScript, used npm package manager, employed a Java syntax tree parsing package, and used Jest
            for testing. I created a simple interactive form for users of this site to test out the API with. The API is currently
            hosted on AWS Lambda with calls routed through AWS API Gateway.
